  <Tab value="Basic Structure">
    ```
    1. Header with your branding
    2. Personal greeting
    3. Main content (news, updates, stories)
    4. Call-to-action (listen, buy, follow)
    5. Footer with social links and unsubscribe
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Visual Elements">
    - Use high-quality images (under 1MB each)
    - Maintain consistent branding
    - Ensure mobile responsiveness
    - Include alt text for accessibility

    - Single column layout
    - Large, tappable buttons
    - Readable font sizes (14px minimum)

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Personalization

### Dynamic Content
Insert personalized elements:
- `{{first_name}}` - Fan's first name
- `{{location}}` - Fan's city/country
- `{{signup_date}}` - When they subscribed
- Custom fields you've collected

### Example Usage
```text
Hey {{first_name}},

Hope you're doing well in {{location}}! 
Since you joined us {{signup_date}}, we've released 3 new songs...
```

## Audience Targeting

<Callout type="info">
Targeted emails get 2-3x higher open rates and 5x higher click rates compared to generic broadcasts.
</Callout>

### Send to All Fans
Send to your entire subscriber list.

### Segment Targeting
Target specific groups:
- **Location**: Fans in specific cities for tour announcements
- **Engagement**: Active vs. inactive subscribers
- **Tags**: Fans interested in specific topics

### A/B Testing
Test different versions with a portion of your audience:
