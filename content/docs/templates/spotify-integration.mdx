## Best Practices

### Template Naming
- Use descriptive names: "Midnight Dreams - Single Release"

- Add date if relevant: "Summer 2024 Release"

### Personalization
- Always fill in the `{{artist_name}}` variable
- Add personal messages to connect with fans
- Customize the header text for your brand

### Timing
- Generate templates before your release date
- Test the template with a small segment first
- Schedule campaigns for optimal engagement times

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Invalid Spotify URL" Error**
- Ensure you're using a valid Spotify track or album URL
- Check for typos in the URL
- Try copying the URL directly from Spotify

**"Failed to fetch data from Spotify" Error**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the Spotify track/album exists and is available
- Try again in a few minutes (rate limiting)

**Missing Platform Links**
- Some platforms require ISRC/UPC codes
- Older releases might have limited metadata
- Links are generated based on available data

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the [Spotify Setup Guide](/docs/integrations/spotify-setup)
2. Verify your Spotify URLs are correct
3. Contact support if problems persist

## Advanced Usage

## API Integration

For developers, the Spotify integration is available via API:

```javascript
// Preview Spotify data
GET /api/spotify/generate-template?url=SPOTIFY_URL

// Create template
POST /api/spotify/generate-template
{
  "spotifyUrl": "SPOTIFY_URL",
  "templateName": "Custom Name"
}
```

This allows for programmatic template generation and integration with external tools.
