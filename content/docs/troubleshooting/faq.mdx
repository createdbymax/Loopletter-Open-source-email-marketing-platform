# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can Loopletter run without AWS?

Yes, but you need to adjust the abstractions in `lib/email-sender.ts` and update the queue worker accordingly. SES is supported out of the box.

## Where can I find the database schema?

A baseline schema export lives in `docs/database/schema.sql`. Apply it with the Supabase CLI or SQL editor, and store future changes in `supabase/migrations/`.

## What background jobs are required?

- `npm run queue-worker` processes campaign sends
- Supabase Edge function `process-email-queue` coordinates send batches
- Optional: AWS EventBridge integration ingests bounce/complaint events

## How do I contribute fixes or docs?

Follow the steps in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md). For documentation-only changes, you can submit PRs without running the full test suite but include screenshots when updating UI docs.

Still stuck? Reach out via GitHub discussions or email support@loopletter.co.
