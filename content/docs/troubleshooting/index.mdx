# Troubleshooting Guide

Use this guide to diagnose configuration or deliverability issues in your Loopletter deployment.

## Environment Checks

- Ensure `.env.local` is populated with every key from the setup guides
- Confirm Supabase credentials (URL, anon key, service role) are correct
- Match Clerk redirect URLs to the domain you are testing from

## Database Connectivity

If you see Supabase authentication errors:

1. Re-run migrations or import the schema dump from `docs/database/schema.sql`
2. Check that Row Level Security policies exist for the `artist`, `campaign`, and `subscription` tables
3. Redeploy any Supabase edge functions after updating environment variables

## Email Deliverability

- Request SES production access and verify sending domains
- Monitor bounce/complaint metrics inside Loopletter analytics
- Enable EventBridge (see root scripts) to sync SES feedback automatically

## Queue Worker Health

- Run `npm run queue-worker` locally to drain jobs
- Verify Redis credentials using the helper scripts in the repository root
- Inspect Supabase Edge function logs for processing errors
