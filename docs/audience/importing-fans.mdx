- **E-commerce**: Shopify, WooCommerce customers

## Data Quality Best Practices

### Email Validation
Our system automatically:
- Checks email format validity
- Identifies obvious typos
- Flags potentially fake addresses
- Removes duplicates

### Cleaning Your List
Before importing:
- Remove old, inactive emails (6+ months)
- Fix obvious typos (gmial.com → gmail.com)
- Remove role-based emails (info@, admin@)
- Verify consent for all contacts

### Consent Management
Ensure you have permission to email everyone:
- **Explicit Consent**: They signed up for your emails
- **Implied Consent**: Existing customers (with opt-out)
- **Legitimate Interest**: Professional contacts (B2B)

<Callout type="warning">
Only import contacts who have given permission to receive your emails. Importing purchased lists or scraping emails violates our terms and hurts deliverability.
</Callout>

## Organizing Your Imports

### Tags and Segments
Organize fans during import:
- **Source Tags**: Where they came from (website, concert, social)
- **Interest Tags**: What they're interested in (tours, merch, new music)
- **Engagement Tags**: How active they are (VIP, casual, new)

### Custom Fields
Collect additional information:
- **Birthday**: For birthday campaigns
- **Location**: For tour targeting
- **Favorite Genre**: For content personalization
- **Purchase History**: For merchandise targeting

## Import Validation

## Post-Import Actions

### Welcome Campaign
Send a welcome email to new imports:

## Common Import Issues

### File Format Problems

- **Special characters**: May cause import errors
- **Large files**: Break into smaller chunks
- **Missing headers**: First row should be column names

### Data Quality Issues

### Permission Issues
- **No consent**: Only import opted-in contacts
