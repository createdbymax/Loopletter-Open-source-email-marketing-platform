## Segment Management

### Dynamic vs Static Segments

#### Dynamic Segments
- Update automatically based on criteria
- Fans move in/out as they meet conditions
- Best for ongoing campaigns
- Examples: "Active Fans", "Local Fans"

#### Static Segments
- Fixed list that doesn't change
- Manual additions/removals only
- Best for specific campaigns
- Examples: "Album Pre-order List", "VIP Event Attendees"

### Segment Maintenance
- **Regular Review**: Check segment performance monthly
- **Update Criteria**: Adjust based on campaign results
- **Clean Inactive**: Remove consistently unengaged fans
- **Test Segments**: A/B test different segmentation approaches

## Segmentation Strategies

### New Artist Strategy
When starting out:
1. **All Fans**: Your entire list
2. **New Subscribers**: Recent signups (welcome series)
3. **Engaged Fans**: Those who open/click regularly
4. **Local Fans**: For local show announcements

### Established Artist Strategy
With larger lists:
1. **Super Fans**: Highest engagement, get exclusive content
2. **Geographic**: Multiple location-based segments
3. **Interest-Based**: Music, tours, merch, personal content
4. **Lifecycle**: New, active, at-risk, inactive fans

### Multi-Genre Artist Strategy
For diverse musical styles:
1. **Genre Preferences**: Rock fans, acoustic fans, electronic fans
2. **Release Types**: Studio albums, live recordings, collaborations
3. **Content Types**: Music-only vs. personal updates
4. **Engagement Level**: Within each genre preference

## Campaign Targeting

### Segment Selection
Choose appropriate segments for each campaign:
- **New Release**: All fans + music-focused segments
- **Tour Announcement**: Geographic segments
- **Merchandise**: Fans with purchase history
- **Personal Update**: Engaged fans who like personal content

### Multi-Segment Campaigns
Send variations to different segments:
- **Subject Lines**: Personalize for each segment

## Measuring Segment Performance

### Key Metrics

- **Click Rate**: Engagement with content
- **Conversion Rate**: Actions taken (purchases, signups)
- **Unsubscribe Rate**: Fans leaving each segment

### Optimization
Improve segments based on data:

## Advanced Segmentation

### Predictive Segments
Use engagement patterns to predict:
- **Likely to Purchase**: Based on past behavior
- **At Risk of Unsubscribing**: Declining engagement
- **High Lifetime Value**: Most valuable fans

### Automated Segmentation
Set up automatic segment management:
