# Email Automation

Automation helps you stay connected with your fans consistently, even when you're busy creating music or touring. Set up sequences that run automatically based on fan behavior and preferences.

## Types of Automation

### Welcome Series
Introduce new subscribers to your music and story.

**Typical Welcome Sequence:**
1. **Immediate Welcome** - Thank them for subscribing
2. **Your Story** (Day 2) - Share your musical journey
3. **Best Music** (Day 5) - Showcase your top tracks
4. **Behind the Scenes** (Day 8) - Personal content
5. **Community** (Day 12) - Connect on social media

### Drip Campaigns
Deliver content over time to build relationships.

**Content Series Examples:**
- **Album Journey**: Share the creation process over weeks
- **Music Education**: Teach about your genre or instruments
- **Tour Diary**: Document your touring experiences
- **Collaboration Stories**: Share stories about working with others

### Behavioral Triggers
Respond to fan actions automatically.

#### Engagement-Based
- **High Engagement**: Special content for super fans
- **Re-engagement**: Win back inactive subscribers
- **Click Behavior**: Follow up on specific interests
- **Social Engagement**: Reward social media interaction

#### Purchase-Based
- **Post-Purchase**: Thank fans for buying music/merch
- **Abandoned Cart**: Remind about incomplete purchases
- **VIP Upgrades**: Special content for paying fans
- **Renewal Reminders**: Subscription or membership renewals

```

#### Interest-Based Branching
```
If fan clicks "Tour Dates":
  â†’ Add to tour interest segment
  â†’ Send tour-focused content
If fan clicks "New Music":
  â†’ Add to music updates segment
  â†’ Send release notifications
```

### Multi-Channel Automation
Coordinate email with other channels:
- **Social Media**: Mention email content on social
