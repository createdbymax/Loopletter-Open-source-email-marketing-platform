## Email Design Best Practices

### Subject Lines
- Keep under 50 characters for mobile
- Create urgency without being spammy
- Personalize when possible: "Hey [Name], new song is here!"
- A/B test different approaches

### Content Structure
```
1. Header with your branding
2. Personal greeting
3. Main content (news, updates, stories)
4. Call-to-action (listen, buy, follow)
5. Footer with social links and unsubscribe
```

### Visual Elements
- Use high-quality images (under 1MB each)
- Maintain consistent branding
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Include alt text for accessibility

## Personalization

### Dynamic Content
Insert personalized elements:
- `{{first_name}}` - Fan's first name
- `{{location}}` - Fan's city/country
- `{{signup_date}}` - When they subscribed
- Custom fields you've collected

### Example Usage
```
Hey {{first_name}},

Hope you're doing well in {{location}}! 
Since you joined us {{signup_date}}, we've released 3 new songs...
```

## Audience Targeting

### Send to All Fans
Send to your entire subscriber list.

### Segment Targeting
Target specific groups:
- **Location**: Fans in specific cities for tour announcements
- **Engagement**: Active vs. inactive subscribers
- **Tags**: Fans interested in specific topics
- **Custom Segments**: Based on multiple criteria

### A/B Testing
Test different versions with a portion of your audience:
- **Subject Lines**: Test 2-3 variations
- **Send Times**: Find optimal timing
- **Content**: Different messaging approaches
- **Call-to-Actions**: Button text and placement

## Scheduling Options

### Send Immediately
Campaign goes out right away after final review.

### Schedule for Later
Choose specific date and time:
- Consider your audience's time zones
- Avoid major holidays unless relevant
- Tuesday-Thursday typically perform best
- 10 AM - 2 PM often sees higher engagement

### Time Zone Optimization
Send at optimal local time for each subscriber's location.

## Preview and Testing

### Email Preview
Check how your email looks:
- Desktop email clients (Gmail, Outlook)
- Mobile devices (iOS Mail, Android)
- Dark mode compatibility

### Test Sends
Send test emails to:
- Your own email addresses
- Team members for feedback
- Different email clients

### Spam Testing

## Campaign Analytics
