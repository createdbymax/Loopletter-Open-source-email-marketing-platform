# Email Domain Setup

Setting up your own domain for email sending is crucial for deliverability, brand recognition, and building trust with your fans.

## Why Set Up Your Domain?

### Better Deliverability
- Higher inbox placement rates
- Lower spam folder placement
- Improved sender reputation
- Better email authentication

### Brand Recognition
- Emails come from your domain (you@yourdomain.com)
- Consistent branding across all communications
- Professional appearance
- Increased fan trust

### Compliance
- Required for high-volume sending
- Meets email authentication standards
- Satisfies ISP requirements
- Reduces risk of being blocked

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you need:
- A domain name you own (yourdomain.com)
- Access to your domain's DNS settings
- Basic understanding of DNS records

If you don't have a domain, you can purchase one from registrars like GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Google Domains.

## Domain Setup Process

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Add Your Domain
    In Loopletter, go to **Settings** → **Domain Setup** → **Add Domain**
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Verify Domain Ownership
    Add a TXT record to prove you own the domain
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Configure DNS Records
    Add SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to your DNS
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Verify Setup
    Our system checks that all records are properly configured
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Start Sending
    Begin sending emails from your verified domain
  </Step>
</Steps>

## DNS Records Explained

### SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
Specifies which servers can send email from your domain.

**Example SPF Record:**
```
Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all
```

### DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
Adds a digital signature to verify email authenticity.

**Example DKIM Record:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: [provided-by-loopletter]._domainkey
Value: [provided-by-loopletter].dkim.amazonses.com
```

### DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)
Tells email providers what to do with emails that fail authentication.

**Example DMARC Record:**
```
Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com
```

## Step-by-Step DNS Configuration

### 1. Access Your DNS Settings
Log into your domain registrar or DNS provider:
- **GoDaddy**: Domain management → DNS
- **Namecheap**: Domain list → Manage → Advanced DNS
- **Cloudflare**: DNS → Records
- **Google Domains**: DNS → Custom records

### 2. Add Domain Verification Record
```
Type: TXT
Name: @ (or leave blank)
Value: [verification-code-from-loopletter]
TTL: 300 (or default)
```

### 3. Add SPF Record
```
Type: TXT
Name: @ (or leave blank)
Value: v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all
TTL: 300
```

<Callout type="warning">
If you already have an SPF record, modify it to include `include:amazonses.com` rather than creating a duplicate.
</Callout>

### 4. Add DKIM Records
You'll receive 3 DKIM records from Loopletter:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: [token1]._domainkey
Value: [token1].dkim.amazonses.com
TTL: 300

Type: CNAME
Name: [token2]._domainkey
Value: [token2].dkim.amazonses.com
TTL: 300

Type: CNAME
Name: [token3]._domainkey
Value: [token3].dkim.amazonses.com
TTL: 300
```

### 5. Add DMARC Record
```
Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com
TTL: 300
```

## Verification Process

### DNS Propagation
After adding records:
- Changes can take 5 minutes to 48 hours
- Most changes propagate within 1-2 hours
- Use DNS checker tools to verify propagation

### Loopletter Verification
Our system checks:
- Domain ownership verification
- SPF record presence and format
- All 3 DKIM records
- DMARC record (optional but recommended)

### Verification Status
- **Pending**: Records not yet detected
- **Verified**: All records found and valid
- **Failed**: Issues with one or more records

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### SPF Record Problems
**Issue**: SPF record not found
**Solution**: 
- Ensure record type is TXT, not SPF
- Use @ or blank for the name field
- Check for typos in the value

**Issue**: Multiple SPF records
**Solution**: 
- Combine into single record
- Use multiple `include:` statements

### DKIM Record Problems
**Issue**: CNAME records not resolving
**Solution**:
- Verify exact name and value from Loopletter
- Some DNS providers require full domain name
- Check TTL settings

### DMARC Record Problems
**Issue**: DMARC policy too strict
**Solution**:
- Start with `p=none` for monitoring
- Gradually move to `p=quarantine` then `p=reject`
- Monitor DMARC reports

### General DNS Issues
**Issue**: Records not propagating
**Solution**:
- Wait longer (up to 48 hours)
- Clear DNS cache
- Try different DNS checker tools
- Contact DNS provider support

## Advanced Configuration

### Subdomain Setup
Use a subdomain for email sending:
- **Setup**: mail.yourdomain.com
- **Benefits**: Isolates email reputation
- **Process**: Same DNS setup on subdomain

### Multiple Domains
Set up multiple domains:
- Different brands or projects
- Geographic variations (.com, .co.uk)
- Backup domains for redundancy

### Custom Return-Path
Advanced users can set custom return-path:
- Better bounce handling
- Improved reputation tracking
- Requires additional DNS setup

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Checks
Monitor your domain setup:
- **Monthly**: Verify DNS records still exist
- **Quarterly**: Review DMARC reports
- **Annually**: Renew domain registration

### Performance Monitoring
Track domain performance:
- **Deliverability rates**: Inbox vs. spam placement
- **Authentication rates**: SPF/DKIM pass rates
- **Reputation scores**: Sender reputation metrics

### DMARC Reports
Analyze DMARC reports for:
- Authentication failures
- Unauthorized sending attempts
- Delivery statistics
- Policy effectiveness

## Best Practices

### Domain Selection
- Use your main brand domain
- Avoid new or suspicious TLDs
- Consider domain age and history
- Ensure domain renewal is current

### DNS Management
- Use reliable DNS providers
- Set appropriate TTL values
- Keep records organized
- Document all changes

### Gradual Rollout
- Start with small email volumes
- Monitor deliverability closely
- Gradually increase sending volume
- Watch for any reputation issues

## Next Steps

After domain setup:
1. [Send your first campaign](/docs/campaigns/creating-campaigns) from your domain
2. [Monitor deliverability](/docs/analytics/deliverability) metrics
3. [Set up email automation](/docs/automation) with your verified domain
4. [Configure team access](/docs/team-management) to domain settings
