# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I deploy without AWS SES?

Loopletter ships with first-class SES support because of its deliverability and pricing. You can swap in another provider by adjusting the abstractions in `lib/email-sender.ts` and the queue worker.

## Where are the database migrations?

SQL used by production is stored as Supabase migrations. You can import the baseline schema from `docs/database/schema.sql` (or generate it from your Supabase project) and track future changes inside `supabase/migrations/`.

## Do I need Redis to send campaigns?

Yes. BullMQ is used to orchestrate high-volume sends. Any Redis provider works (Upstash, AWS Elasticache, Docker). Update `REDIS_URL` and `REDIS_TLS` in `.env.local` to point at your instance.

## How do I run the queue worker in production?

Use `npm run queue-worker` on a dedicated process. On Vercel or other serverless platforms you can deploy the worker as a separate Node process (Render, Fly.io, Railway, etc.).

## Is there a Docker setup?

A `Dockerfile` is included for container deployments. Pass in your environment variables and mount a persistent volume if you plan to store uploaded assets locally.
